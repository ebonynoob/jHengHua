                    If this is not reasonably possible, Trader will indicate, before the Distance Contract
                    is concluded, in what way the general terms and conditions are available for
                    inspection at the Trader’s premises and that they will be sent free of charge

                    If the Distance Contract is concluded
                    electronically, then, contrary to the previous paragraph, and before the Distance
                    Contract is concluded, Consumer will be provided with the text of these general
                    terms and conditions electronically, in such a way that Consumer can easily
                    store them on a Durable Medium. If this is not reasonably possible, then before
                    concluding the Distance Contract, Trader will indicate where the general terms
                    and conditions can be inspected electronically and that at his request they

                    will take suitable technical and organizational measures to secure the
                    electronic transfer of data and he will ensure a safe web environment. If Consumer
                    is able to pay electronically, Trader will take suitable security measures.
